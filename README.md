This project was created by me as a solution to a challenge provided by devChallenges.
The task was to create a responsive page according to the provided layout.

My solution is made using simple technologies like HTML and CSS.
I used the CSS Grid to layout the main part of the page with a description of the team (table), as well as direct cards of team members. So, with a small amount of time, I managed to make a non-standard layout of cards, which was required by the design layout.
I also used Flexbox to display a description of the page's purpose.
Out of habit, I used the SCSS preprocessor when writing styles, as I find it convenient to work with nested selectors.

When I was working with this task it was new for me to use the mobile-first strategy and work with the writing-mode property. I find this knowledge useful in the future and will gladly continue to use it when the opportunity arises.
